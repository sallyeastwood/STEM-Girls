                    <h3>Katherine Johnson</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>“I counted everything. I counted the steps to the road, the steps up to church, the number of dishes and silverware I washed … anything that could be counted, I did.” said Katherine Johnson, recipient of the 2015 National Medal of Freedom.</p>
                        <p>Born in 1918 in the little town of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Johnson was a research mathematician, who by her own admission, was simply fascinated by numbers. In 1953, she began working for NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The NACA had taken the unusual step of hiring African- American women for the tedious and precise work of measuring and calculating the results of wind tunnel tests in 1935. The NACA was so pleased with the results that, unlike many organizations, they kept the women computers at work after the war.  By 1953 the growing demands of early space research meant there were openings for African-American computers at Langley Research Center’s Guidance and Navigation Department, which was the perfect place for Johnson to put her extraordinary mathematical skills to work.</p>
                        <p>Johnson calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard, the first American in space. Even after NASA began using electronic computers, John Glenn requested that she personally recheck the calculations made by the new electronic computers before his flight aboard Friendship 7 – the mission on which he became the first American to orbit the Earth. She continued to work at NASA until 1986 combining her math talent with electronic computer skills. Her calculations proved as critical to the success of the Apollo Moon landing program and the start of the Space Shuttle program.</p>
